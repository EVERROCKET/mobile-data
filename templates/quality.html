	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p>When I looked at the raw data I realized that it would be difficult to clean and bin the data so that it could be more easily visualized to tell a story. As the locations and activities were collected every few minutes, and they were across the whole month, I needed to deleted some of them to make the time gap between collected data larger. Since I wanted to explore the relationship between the time (frequency) and locations and the relationship between the time (in hours) and activities, the cleaned data has a relatively good quality. But some of them might not be accurate and some are also missing.</a></p>
      </div>

    
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p>It seems to me that there is no significant amount of missing data. Every day, the amount of data is similar. Or, the missing data doesn’t affect much on my goals.
</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>It does make sense to me. In the locations data, the heat map I created matched perfectly my daily/weekly routine. I haven’t even thought about specifically the places I spent most of my time every day and week. When the map came out, I thought that is actually how I spend my time. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>Initially, I didn’t recogize some of the heated places on the map, but most of them made sense to me. For the activities, the data recognized I was running in some time. They were at night and morning. However, I didn’t run in these time. I guessed it might be me just getting on the buses? For other parts, the data were correct from my expectations. </p>
